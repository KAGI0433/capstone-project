            <h2>5 Must-Have Features in <br> an E-Commerce Website</h2>
            <h3><a href="https://melsoft.co.za/5-must-have-features-in-an-e-commerce-website/#respond">Leave a comment /</a><a href="https://melsoft.co.za/category/e-commerce/">E-Commerce,</a><a href="https://melsoft.co.za/category/web-development/">Website Development/</a> <a href="https://melsoft.co.za/author/admin/">By Melsoft</a></h3>
            <h2>What is E-commerce</h2>
           <p>E-COMMERCE! It’s something that has become as common a part of our routine as waking up, being locked down, staying at home, isolating and all. Now more than ever, a quick dash to the mall has evolved into a quick search, a few swipes and et voila, you’ve received a delivery notice and now all you have to do is wait, and maybe finish binging on that Netflix series you’d paused a minute ago.</p>
           <p>The simple technical definition is that any buying and selling of goods and the financial transactions that facilitate this qualify as e-commerce. Your website essentially becomes the digital embodiment of your physical shop. In the best of instances, your website invites customers, entices them with your products, closes the sale, handles the transactions and provides happiness to them and to you, and that’s why a good one is very important.</p>
           <h3>Why is E-Commerce Important</h3>
           <p>E-Commerce has become a very important element in any business, especially moving forward into post-Covid life. Essentially more and more people will embrace online shopping because of its “social distancing” nature. <a href="https://melsoft.co.za/%22https:/insights.wundermanthompsoncommerce.com/hubfs/@UK/Landing%20Pages/2020/COVID,%20Commerce%20and%20the%20Consumer/WTC%20-%20COVID,%20Commerce%20and%20the%20Consumer%20-%20UK.pdf?hsCtaTracking=93dd7c79-5796-49ec-9a84-efb852f5e587%7Cf4f4372b-5c86-42d6-886c-3ccdb361a6b8%22">Wunderman Thompson</a> reports 40% more consumers are now more comfortable with online shopping than they were pre-Covid. In South Africa alone, E-Commerce is projected <a href="https://melsoft.co.za/%22https:/www.statista.com/outlook/243/112/ecommerce/south-africa#market-globalRevenue\%22">to generate over USD 4 billion revenue in 2021.</a> That\’s a serious figure!</p>
           <h2>Key Features</h2>
           <h3>1. Simplicity</h3>
           <p>Your website intends to SELL, thus closing that sale is your priority and all focus should be on that. Simplicity will go a long way in highlighting that focus. Keep your page as simple as possible and avoid distracting the potential client from what they came to do, which is to buy. Avoid pop-ups & banners as these will take away the focus on your sale. Show the product, show the price, add the complimentary features if any like free shipping and close that sale.</p>
           <p>On a B2C E-Commerce website, most customers are there to buy and leave in as convenient and fast a time as possible. If you have product text or any other text that contains information you wish to convey, keep that text as “scannable” as possible. You want the consumer to be able to read and get all that information with a glance. You don’t want to run the risk of them getting side-tracked by reading a long description or at worst get bored by a long winding paragraph and not go through with their purchase.</p>
           <h2>2. Ease of Navigation</h2>
           <p>Make your website easy to navigate and use. The journey from search to product selection to payment and any detours in-between should be as painless as possible and one click away at best. A well-designed navigation menu goes a long way in keeping customers happy, and happy customers are generous customers.</p>
           <p>Make your additional offers as clear, concise and obvious as possible. More often than not these offers like free delivery or discounts are the sale closers, the difference between an abandoned cart and you sending that personalized “thank you for shopping with us” email. Make them visible so the customer knows there’s an offer. Make them clear so the customer knows exactly what’s on offer. Avoid trick words and fine print conditions, these always leave a customer feeling deceived and cheated. That credibility hit will lose you more money than any fine print can save you.</p>
